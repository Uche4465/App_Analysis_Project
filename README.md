# Determining the Profitable Mobile App on Apple Store and Google Play store

#### About The Project  
This Project is for a company that builds free Android and iOS mobile apps and has made their apps available on Google Play and in the App Store. Our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads.
This means that the number of users of our apps determines our revenue for any given app. The more users who see and engage with the ads, the better.

#### Project Goal 
The goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers
understand what type of apps is likely to attract more users.

#### Analysis
In this project, we went through a complete data science workflow:

We started by clarifying the goal of our project.
We collected relevant data.
We cleaned the data to prepare it for analysis.
We analyzed the cleaned data.

#### Libraries
No external library was used during the data cleaning and analysis in this project.


#### Conclusion
In this project, data from Apple Store and Google Play Store mobile apps were analysed with the goal of recommending an app profile that can be profitable for both markets. 
The step implemented in achieving this goal is to find the most popular apps by genre on Apple Store and Google Play Store. 

From the analysis, on Apple Store we observe that Navigation, Reference, Social networking and Music genres attract more users. While on Google Play Store, the following genres which are Communication, Video Player and Social genres attract more users as well.

Designing an app that would attract users on both platforms, we need to put together the features of the most user attracting apps by genre on Apple and Google Play store. 
By doing so, I would recommend the developers to design an eBook Reader app that has the following features:
1. Ability to play the audio version of any eBook uploaded on the reader
2. Ability to visualize the concept, ideas or message from each chapter in comic/illustated form though the video version of the eBook reader.
3. A dashboard for all readers where they can be able to track their reading progress, add new friends.
4. A chat forum where potential readers can meet, discuss and share ideas.

These features were put together from Reference, Music, Video Player and Social genres respectively; which are the most user attracting genres on both Apple and Google Play store.
